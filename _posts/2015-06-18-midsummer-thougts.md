Its usually rains for the midsummer, a way to annoy all the Swedes for
whos it is the biggest celebration of the year. Some years ago I, even
I got invited to a party, obviously didn't do that well, as there ware
no more invitations...

Anyway, I always quite sad about the midsummer day. It seems the
summer didn't yet start, there was maybe one warmer day so far, but
then people are telling me, already half of the summer is gone. Oh
well, maybe the warm days will come, and I will do some swimming in
the open sea. Today I didn't need to go to the water, it came to me,
quite refreshing rain, after an hour bicycle ride, I was very re-
freshed and now need to wash and dry all the clothes.

if it still rains tomorrow, I could try to implement support for image
attachments, in the mail to Jekyll program. It would be nice, then all
the hackers could quickly post a pictures to the blogs and soon github
will be more popular then facebook and instagram.

OK, now I know, how difficult it is to write a blog.
Happy midsummar.
