Epised 2 of the Sunday DoJo show.

This week we implement a class listing all the possible permutations of the letters in a given string.

The source code is available at: [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/przemekr/dojos/sunday_dojo_show/)

I used some VIM features like:

* words, lines completion with ctrl-p, ctrl-l
* filter a line through external program with :.! program
* repeat the last change with '.'

There are few C++ features used:

* inherit the interface and implementation from a std container
* 'auto' types http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/lang...
* anonymous functions: http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++...

Watch the video, try to do the excessive on your own. Make it several times, once you make it without trouble, try some new concepts and features in your editor to make those a habit.

There is no better way to learn!
