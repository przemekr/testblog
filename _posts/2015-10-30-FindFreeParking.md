A image processing test. The idea is to scan a parking loth photo taken from a
neaerby building and use image processing to find where and how many free
parking places there are.

In this test project there are two parts a simple script to process an image
file. Then there is a android based client application to dispay the date on a
mobile phone.

Still a draft. The work was done as part of a hackathon even.
