Import Sina Blog and generate great looking own blog! (by Jenny)

A great tool to free your blog from a commercial company. Fetch all the text
and picture data from a Sina [Sina](blog.sina.com.cn). The tool can generate
then an HTML page, or a PDF document, as well as export all data as Jekyll
project. 

The source code is nice showcase of using regular expression pattern matching
in Python.
