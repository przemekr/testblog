Screen Cast video series for coding skills practice. 

Every week a new programming exercise. Every week a lot of new Vim, C++, gtests and other programming tips.

Watch the video, try to do the excessive on your own. Make it several times, once you make it without trouble, try some new concepts and features in your editor to make those a habit.

There is no better way to learn!
