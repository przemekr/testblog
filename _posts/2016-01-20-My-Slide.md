A simple photo slide show generator. Watch your latest photos mixed together.

My Slide with load the photos form the latest days (or weeks or months) and
generate a slide show with a nice transition effect. A random music from your
music folder can be played.

It works quite well now. Still it is rather drafty implementation. Some updates
I still need to do:

* Improve performance so that a higher resolutions could be used.
* Better user interface, more control in choosing the photos.
* Possibly other transitions effects.
