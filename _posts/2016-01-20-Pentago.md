Pentago Board Game for Android. 

[Pentago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago)

Abstract turn based strategy game for two players. Five in a row with additional complexity of board rotation in every move. 
Best computer player for Pentago mobile application! 

Was really difficult to program the computer player ... or maybe just I made quite many mistakes trying to do too much optimization from the begin. In the end I removed most of the "great ideas" and it is running more or less standard Alpha-Betta puring Min-Max algorithm.
