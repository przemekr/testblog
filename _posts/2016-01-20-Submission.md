A political fiction book

The novel, a political satire, imagines a situation in which a Muslim party
upholding traditionalist and patriarchal values leads the 2022 vote in France
and is able to form a government with the support of France Islamo-Leftist
Socialist Party.

Did not like it. Only two stars. Interesting idea. Pessimistic vision. Shows
what is worst in humans. That all are opportunists happy to give away freedom
and responsibility for personal benefits. (But I do not believe it).
