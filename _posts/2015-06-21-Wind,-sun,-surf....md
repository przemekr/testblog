The long weekend started a bit rainy, the ended with a bit
of a sunny weather.

Yesterday I started windsurfing in the rain, but then the
Swedish weather had a bit mercy for me, and the sun came.
The wind was not very strong, but stable -- a good weather
to practice turns and technique. I almost learn myself to
['jibe'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecVsTGLXTk). Today also 3h on the water:
[workout-track](http://www.sports-tracker.com/workout/przemekrz/5586d973e4b094b774fc6265),

and then a bit midsummer picnic with other collogues from the
windsurfing club. It is quite a nice place and the people
are friendly, so if you are keen to do some water sports, go
to [SWK](http://www.swk.se/)
