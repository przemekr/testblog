In this episode we implement a solution finder for a 24 Game.

In the game player is given 4 random cards with numbers 1-12, the goal is to
shuffle the cards and combine then with arithmetic operators to get 24 as a
result.

Sometimes it is difficult to find a solution so lets write a program to help
us.
