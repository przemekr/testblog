Yesterday I saw you in a crowd of people, everyone rushing on a busy passage.
Suddenly, there was you. How? did you came earlier? I felt a surprise for an
instant before the next beat of the heart brought all the other emotions. I was
happy. I was sad. I was speechless. You smile so gently. Someone standing next
to you. A short 'hi' seemed so difficult. I am sorry. Look down. Another heart
beat. Could I see you the smile once more? I wakeup.
