A sample home page generated with Jekyll.

It could be used to track all the user projects/ books/ movies and other
interests.

Using Jekyll will allow to use a markdown syntax rather then raw HTML. Some
build in tempates and template language i.e. itterating through all the post
with given tag. 

Now, the idea is to group the Jekyll posts by tag. There are predefined tags in
the navigation bar and the matching posts will be displayed there. This change
a typical 'blog' like webpage, generated by Jekyll to more general purpuse home
page.
